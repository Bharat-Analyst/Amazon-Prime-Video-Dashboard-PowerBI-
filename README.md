# Amazon-Prime-Video-Dashboard-PowerBI-

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing 9,600+ titles on Amazon Prime Video across genres, ratings, and global distribution. Visualized key metrics such as title count, genre diversity, rating distribution, and release trends from 1920 to 2021. Integrated map visuals to show country-wise content availability and used dynamic charts (bar, line, donut) to highlight top genres and content types (TV vs. Movies). Enabled stakeholders to explore viewer preferences, identify content gaps, and make data-informed licensing or production decisions.
